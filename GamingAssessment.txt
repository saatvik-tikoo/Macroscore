What about:
1. Changing what is asked Randomly i.e. Changing the features randomly so that no one knows which feature has been choosen

We can stop maniputation in two ways:
1. When the person is scared of doing it. i.e. He should think that the manipulation that he is trying to do can even worsen the results
	: Including Randomeness. If we include more than the features that we need where some of the features are highly correlated then we can choose 
	randomly one of the feature out of all the features and check for the Score. This way we can do this random picking multiple times and
	then take a average score. Here the idea of Worsening of score can be thought like penalizing the final average score of the multiple 
	individual scores had a lot of difference between them.

2. Not giving him a choice at all. This way the features should be suseptible to gaming. Here we choose only those features that he cannot change.
